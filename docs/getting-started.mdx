:::caution
Before getting started, you should know **this is alpha software**. Blitz is incomplete. There are rough spots and bugs. APIs may change. But you can build an app and deploy it to production. We're excited to see what you build!

If you have any issues at all, please [open an issue](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/issues/new/choose) or join the [Blitz slack](https://slack.blitzjs.com) and talk to us in the **#help** channel. If you get stuck and frustrated, please don't blame yourself. Our docs are not yet fine-tuned for those with less experience. But eventually, it will be because this is very important to us!
