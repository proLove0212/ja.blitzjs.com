Blitz was [initially birthed in February 2020](https://twitter.com/flybayer/status/1229425878481793024), by Brandon Bayer. When he first announced Blitz, he only had a couple hundred lines of prototype code. But the idea resonated with so many people, that many jumped in and helped architect and build the very first alpha version. [38 amazing people](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/tree/ab6f60571ad61eef6be55e9684f2e243fa902e8d#contributors-) contributed to the first alpha which was [released on April 24, 2020](https://twitter.com/flybayer/status/1253649008540569600).
