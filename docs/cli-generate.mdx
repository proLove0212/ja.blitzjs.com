**Alias: `blitz g`**

Use this command to scaffold all the boring code into your project.

Can generate pages, queries, and mutations. Generating `Prisma` models is coming soon. Also coming soon is support for custom templates based on the built-in templates so you can customize the generator to your app's needs.

```bash
blitz generate [type] [model]
```

| Argument | Required | Description                                                                             |
| -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`   | Yes      | Type of files to generate. Options: `all`, `crud`, `queries`, `mutations`, and `pages`. |
| `model`  | Yes      | The model name to generate files for                                                    |

##### Example Output

`blitz generate all project` will generate the following files:

```
app/projects/pages/projects/[projectId]/edit.tsx
app/projects/pages/projects/[projectId].tsx
app/projects/pages/projects/index.tsx
app/projects/pages/projects/new.tsx
app/projects/components/ProjectForm.tsx
app/projects/queries/getProject.ts
app/projects/queries/getProjects.ts
app/projects/mutations/createProject.ts
app/projects/mutations/deleteProject.ts
app/projects/mutations/updateProject.ts
```

For the above example, you can view the generated project index page at [localhost:3000/projects](http://localhost:3000/projects)

### Options

##### `context/model`

For organization of files within your project, you can specify a nested folder path in which to generate the files.

```bash
blitz generate all admin/products

// Will generate files in `app/admin/products` instead of `app/products`
```

Alternatively, you can provide the folder path via the `--context` or `-c` options

##### `--parent`

Shorthand: `-p`

Used to specify that you want to generate files for a model which is a child of a parent model.

For example, say you have `Project` and `Task` models. A `Task` belongs to a `Project` and `Project` has many `Tasks`. You would run this command:

```bash
blitz generate all task --parent project
```

which would generate the following files:

```
app/tasks/pages/projects/[projectId]/tasks/[taskId]/edit.tsx
app/tasks/pages/projects/[projectId]/tasks/[taskId].tsx
app/tasks/pages/projects/[projectId]/tasks/index.tsx
app/tasks/pages/projects/[projectId]/tasks/new.tsx
app/tasks/components/TaskForm.tsx
app/tasks/queries/getTask.ts
app/tasks/queries/getTasks.ts
app/tasks/mutations/createTask.ts
app/tasks/mutations/deleteTask.ts
app/tasks/mutations/updateTask.ts
```

##### `--dry-run`

Shorthand: `-d`

Displays what files would be generated but does not write the files to disk.

### Examples

```bash
blitz generate all project
```

```bash
blitz generate mutations project
```

```bash
blitz generate crud admin/topsecret/files
```

```bash
blitz generate pages tasks --parent=projects
```
